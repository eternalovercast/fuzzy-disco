Low latency communication systems are important to future generation networks, as packages arrive in a system, they first go through a queuing system and are then allocated to different processors. The aim of this project is to design a queuing system that dynamically adjusts the number of packages passed onto the (already developed) allocation algorithm, with the aim of satisfying the delay constraints of the packages. This can be achieved by extracting information from the traffic pattern. The queuing system is expected to be developed via Matlab.
